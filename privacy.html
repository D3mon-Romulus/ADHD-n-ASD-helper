    <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children and families using this application. This policy explains our data practices.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>This application does NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. We do not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collect names, emails, or contact information</li>
      <li>Track user behavior or analytics</li>
      <li>Use cookies for tracking purposes</li>
      <li>Share data with third parties</li>
      <li>Sell or monetize user data</li>
      <li>Require user accounts or registration</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All application data is stored locally on your device using browser localStorage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Child profiles (names and ages)</li>
      <li>Tasks and routines</li>
      <li>Behavior tracking records</li>
      <li>Points and progress data</li>
      <li>Application settings and preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and is only accessible on the device where it was created.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Control</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can delete all data at any time through the Parent Dashboard</li>
      <li>Clearing browser data will remove all stored information</li>
      <li>No data recovery is possible once deleted</li>
      <li>You are responsible for backing up data if needed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
    <p>This application is designed for children aged 3-18 but does not collect any personal information as defined by COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act). Since no data is transmitted or stored on external servers, traditional COPPA consent mechanisms are not required. However:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Parental supervision is strongly recommended</li>
      <li>Parents should review all features before allowing child use</li>
      <li>The Parent PIN system provides basic access control</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>If you install this as a PWA or access it through a hosting platform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The hosting provider may collect basic server logs (IP addresses, access times)</li>
      <li>These logs are not controlled by this application</li>
      <li>Refer to your hosting provider's privacy policy for details</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Security depends on your device's security measures</li>
      <li>Use device passwords/locks to protect data</li>
      <li>Be cautious when using on shared devices</li>
      <li>The Parent PIN provides basic app-level protection</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Any changes to this policy will be posted here. Significant changes will be noted in the application.</p>
